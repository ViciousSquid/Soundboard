# Soundboard
 A simple tool for assigning audio files (WAV or MP3) onto buttons. Useful in live/studio productions with a touch-screen.

I would absolutely welcome any suggestions for improvements, changes, advice.

My goal is for this to evolve into a digital toolbox for audio production. Small app with big dreams.


## Requirements

pygame 1.9.6 or greater


## Usage
Execute main.py

To load an audio file onto a button, use the "File" menu to choose an audio file. Once selected, the corresponding button will display the name of the loaded file.
Only six files are currently supported at a time (one for each button) if you need more than this, launch another instance. 

Suggestions/contributions welcomed
