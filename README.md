# Soundboard
 A simple tool for assigning audio files (WAV or MP3) onto buttons. Designed scenarios are for live or studio productions with a touch-screen device

## Requirements

pygame==1.9.6


## Usage

To load an audio file onto a button, use the "File" menu to choose an audio file. Once selected, the corresponding button will display the name of the loaded file.
Only six files are currently supported at a time (one for each button) if you need more than this, launch another instance. 

Suggestions/contributions welcomed for improvement!
