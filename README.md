I built this tool for my work needs; one-day it may become a toolbox for audio engineers. Currently very basic.


## Requirements

pygame==1.9.6


## Usage
Execute main.py

To load an audio file onto a button, use the "File" menu to choose an audio file. Once selected, the corresponding button will display the name of the loaded file.
Only six files are currently supported at a time (one for each button) if you need more than this, launch another instance. 

Suggestions/contributions welcomed
